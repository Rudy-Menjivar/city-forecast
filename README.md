# City Forecast

## Task

Build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser with dynamically updated HTML & CSS.  This dashboard will retrieve weather data for several cities by using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

The weather dashboard will need to be built with
- Form inputs, including the ability to search for a city

Once a city search begins:
- Present the current and future conditions for that city
- The searched city will be added to the search history

The details of the current weather conditions for that city will include:
- The city name and the date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- Temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index

The UV index will be presented with colors to indicate:
- Whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

The future weather conditions for that city will present:
- A 5-day forecast that displays the date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- Temperature and humidity

If a city is clicked from search history, then user is presented with:
- Current and future conditions for that city

When the weather dashboard is opened again, then:
- Present the last searched city forecast
